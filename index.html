            We could talk about infinitely many productive and cool things in our lives, but eh, where's the fun in that? Time to yap about <em>yappity</em> things.<br><br>
            So, in today's episode of Yapper TV, we present to you:<br>
            <strong>"Rate Indonesian Baddies x/10"!!!</strong><br><br>
            No, you dirty brain, shush.<br>
            I'm talking about the islands! The Indonesian archipelago has the most islands (like, 17,000 or something), and no, I'm not citing any sources—duh, do you see what this website is called? Why would I reveal all my secret sources to you anyway, huh? Go away! Just take my claims at face value because I'm smart. Smarter than Wikipedia or ChatGPT... or maybe even your mom (I don't know, haven't met her—YET!).<br><br>
            Hmm, let's see… let's go from the biggest to the smallest, because my ex always said, "Your eyes only notice the big ones." And of course, I can't do anything but obey.
